### Project description
The goal of the project is to get a hands-on experience in executing a real project. We go through the whole iterative process of problem identification, data collection, data
exploration, model specification, data analyses, model evaluation and testing, result interpretation, and
presentation.

### Background
The Superhost certication program is used by Airbnb to provide guests with a clear and visible platform-initiated indicator of host quality.

Airbnb assesses whether a host has met the Superhost criteria once every three months. If a host meets the criteria, the host attains Superhost status and keeps that status until the next evaluation period. From the inception of this certification program (2009) until October 2018, Airbnb hosts must have met the following criteria over the previous 365 days to be awarded the Superhost status: 

1. hosted at least 10 trips;
2. maintained a 90% response rate when responding to guests requests; 
3. completed all confirmed reservations without cancellation; and 
4. received a 5-star review at least 80% of the time.
   
Airbnb uses specific “evaluation periods” to assess whether hosts have met the Superhost certification
criteria. The three-month evaluation periods begin on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st.
Each host’s Superhost status is reevaluated at the beginning of the subsequent evaluation period, usually
within 10 days of the start of the evaluation period (i.e., for a January 1st evaluation period, each host’s
status is adjusted, if necessary, by January 10th).


### Analysis Overview

In the Platform business model of AirBnB, there two players, the hosts that list their properties on the platform, and the customers that book these properties. In our analysis we focus on empowering hosts to qualify as superhosts, and optimize their listings and earnings.

1. Checked if being a superhost helps in any way ? Increased revenues, bookings ?

2. As new / small hosts are the biggest beneficiaries, we will try to answer a few questions for
a new host trying to enter the Airbnb market :
   - In the given city, which tract or group of tracts should they buy a property ?
   - Once the tract is finalised, we want to suggest the best configuration of a property
   which can lead to the most revenues for the host.

1. Now for the small hosts who already are listing some properties on Airbnb, we check the
effect of seasonality, and how can they control these parameters based on the season, and
maximise their returns
